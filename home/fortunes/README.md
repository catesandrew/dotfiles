## What is Fortune?

Fortune is a simple Unix program that displays a random message from a database of quotations.

```
$ fortune

"What we see is mainly what we look for."
  ~Unknown
```

This directory contains some fortune database files.

Then install the database files.

## How to automatically launch fortune when opening a shell window

Depending on which shell you use, at the end of your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, copy the following lines into it.

```bash
echo
echo "=============== Quote Of The Day ==============="
echo
fortune
echo
echo "================================================"
echo
```

## How to make your own fortune database file

1. Write your fortune items into a file.
2. Append a percent sign (%) after each item. The percent sign should take a new line. The following is an example.

    ```
    A day for firm decisions!!!!!  Or is it?
    %
    A few hours grace before the madness begins again.
    %
    A gift of a flower will soon be made to you.
    %
    A long-forgotten loved one will appear soon.

    Buy the negatives at any price.
    %
    A tall, dark stranger will have more fun than you.
    ```

3. Generate the index file.

    ```bash
    strfile -c % your-fortune-file your-fortune-file.dat
    ```

4. Move the fortune file and its index file into `/usr/share/games/fortunes/`.
